- Get your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from the Spotify API
- Save them as string values in a file named ".env"
- ".env" should be empty except for these credentials.
- Run the "main.py" file by changing the inital letter to a-z and 0-9.
- Each time you run the file with different letter/digit you will generate a csv with artists details staring with that letter/digit.
